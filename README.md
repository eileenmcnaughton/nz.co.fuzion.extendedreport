# Support
If you hit an issue please create an issue against this repo. I do look at these & fix as many as I can.

This extension is supported for the 5.x series as of the release of 5.0 and there is no intention to issue further
releases for CiviCRM 4.x. That applies to bug fixes, new features and security patches.
